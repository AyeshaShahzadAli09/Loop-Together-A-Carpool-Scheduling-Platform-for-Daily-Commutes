# Test Cases Report

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the test cases implemented for the Loop Together Carpool Scheduling Platform. The testing strategy follows a comprehensive approach covering unit testing, functional testing, integration testing, and performance testing to ensure the platform meets all specified requirements and delivers a reliable user experience.

Testing is conducted to verify and validate software functionality, ensuring that all components work as expected both individually and together. Our testing approach follows industry best practices:

- **Independent Tests**: Each test runs independently without relying on other tests
- **Meaningful Assertions**: Clear and descriptive assertions for easy debugging
- **Test Data Management**: Proper setup and teardown procedures
- **Avoiding Hardcoded Values**: Using variables and configurations for flexibility
- **Repeatable Tests**: Tests can be run multiple times with consistent results
